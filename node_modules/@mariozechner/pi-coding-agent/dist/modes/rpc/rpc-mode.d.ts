 * - Commands: JSON objects with `type` field, optional `id` for correlation
 * - Responses: JSON objects with `type: "response"`, `command`, `success`, and optional `data`/`error`
 * - Events: AgentSessionEvent objects streamed as they occur
 * - Extension UI: Extension UI requests are emitted, client responds with extension_ui_response
