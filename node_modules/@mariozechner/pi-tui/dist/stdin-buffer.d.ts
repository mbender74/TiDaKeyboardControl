/**
 * StdinBuffer buffers input and emits complete sequences.
 *
 * This is necessary because stdin data events can arrive in partial chunks,
 * especially for escape sequences like mouse events. Without buffering,
 * partial sequences can be misinterpreted as regular keypresses.
 *
 * For example, the mouse SGR sequence `\x1b[<35;20;5m` might arrive as:
 * - Event 1: `\x1b`
 * - Event 2: `[<35`
 * - Event 3: `;20;5m`
 *
 * The buffer accumulates these until a complete sequence is detected.
 * Call the `process()` method to feed input data.
